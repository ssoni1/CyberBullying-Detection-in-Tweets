In the digital age, cyberbullying has become a serious problem, especially on social media sites. By creating an online tool for Twitter cyberbullying detection utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to address this issue. The application's primary function is to categorize text according to the age, gender, ethnicity, and religion of the users. Data gathering, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and evaluation, and front-end design utilizing the Streamlit framework are some of the processes that the project goes through. Tokenization, word embeddings, and feature selection are used to extract features from the collected Twitter dataset once it has been cleaned and normalized. To classify cyberbullying, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained and improved. Moreover, Users can enter text into the Streamlit front-end to get real-time predictions about cyberbullying situations. The application offers details on the users' racial and ethnic demographics. The project's successes, difficulties, constraints, and opportunities for additional effort are discussed. This project promotes a safer and more inclusive digital environment by utilizing NLP and machine learning to develop efficient tools for detecting and combatting cyberbullying in online platforms.
